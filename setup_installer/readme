Steps to setup lab
	
	=> install rootless docker  : https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/docker/
	
	=> install rootless docker compose :
			curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o $HOME/bin/docker-compose
			
	=> run install.sh script to perform settings to run lab setup
	
	=> pull all images needed by docker-complose.yml
	 
	=> copy vs-codium app image from :  https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases

How does this setup work (docker-compose, set_env_bashrc, proxy cmds )
	=> create conatiners from docker-compose file
	=> scripts inside dir(.command_scripts) intersecpt java, gcc, python commands
	=> these intersecpted(proxy) commands execute actual commands on the conatiners
	=> update $PATH in .bashrc to redirect commands to dir(.command_scripts)
	=> update .bashrc to expose environment variables needed by main(proxy) script.

Steps to install a new language inside this lab setup
	=> add the new service inside docker-compose file
	=> export environment variables inside .docker/setEnvVar.sh script
		LAB_1234_XXX_CONTAINER_NAME
	=> create command intersecpter inside directory(command_scripts)

The docker-compose.yml containes following container services
	=> apache	(php:7.2-apache)
	=> mariadb	(mariadb:10.7.3-focal)
	=> adminer	(adminer)
	=> python10	(python:3.10.4-bullseye)
	=> gcc11	(gcc:11.2-bullseye)
	=> java17	(openjdk:jdk)
	=> portainer(portainer/portainer-ce)
	=> vscodeserver (codercom/code-server) : need more configuration

Steps To remove this setup
	=> remove line from $HOME/.bashrc
			source /home/........./.docker/setEnvVar.sh
	=> remove directory(code)
	=> docker-compose down
	=> docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=created -q)
	=> docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
	=> remove all container images
	=> remove directory containing setup/installation files
	=> remove XAMPP.desktop file from desktop
